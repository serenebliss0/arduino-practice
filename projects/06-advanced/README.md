## Best Practices

1. **Plan Before Coding**
   - Draw system diagrams
   - List all components and connections
   - Plan software architecture

2. **Modular Design**
   - Use functions and classes
   - Separate concerns
   - Make code reusable

3. **Testing**
   - Test components individually
   - Integrate incrementally
   - Document issues and solutions

4. **Documentation**
   - Comment complex logic
   - Document pin assignments
   - Keep wiring diagrams updated

5. **Version Control**
   - Commit working versions
   - Document changes
   - Keep backups

## Common Challenges
