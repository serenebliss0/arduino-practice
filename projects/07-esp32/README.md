## 🛠️ Before You Start

### 1. Set Up ESP32
- Follow [ESP32_GETTING_STARTED.md](../../ESP32_GETTING_STARTED.md) for initial setup
- Test with blink example
- Verify WiFi and Bluetooth work

### 2. Install Required Libraries
Many projects use these common libraries:
```
- WiFi (built-in)
- WebServer (built-in)
- HTTPClient (built-in)
- PubSubClient (MQTT)

```

### 3. Prepare Your Environment
- Set up WiFi credentials file (see template in resources)
- Install serial monitor terminal (PuTTY, CoolTerm, or Arduino IDE)
- Install mobile apps for Bluetooth projects
- Set up MQTT broker (if needed) - Mosquitto, CloudMQTT, or HiveMQ

### 4. Safety First
- ESP32 is 3.3V - use level shifters for 5V components
- Use proper power supply (5V 1-2A recommended)
- Add reverse polarity protection for battery projects
- Use appropriate resistors for LEDs
- Be careful with relay projects - AC voltage is dangerous!

## 🔧 Common Issues & Solutions

### WiFi Problems
**Issue**: Can't connect to WiFi  
**Solution**: 
- Ensure 2.4GHz network (ESP32 doesn't support 5GHz)
- Check SSID and password
- Move closer to router
- Verify network allows new devices

### Upload Problems
**Issue**: Failed to connect  
**Solution**:
- Hold BOOT button during upload
- Install correct USB drivers (CP2102 or CH340)
- Try lower upload speed (115200)
- Check USB cable quality

### Memory Issues
**Issue**: Out of memory errors  
**Solution**:
- Use PROGMEM for large strings
- Minimize global variables
- Use SPIFFS for large data
- Clear unused libraries

### Power Issues
**Issue**: ESP32 resets randomly  
**Solution**:
- Use better power supply (2A recommended)
- Add 100µF capacitor near ESP32
