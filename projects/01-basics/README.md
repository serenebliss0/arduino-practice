# Basics Projects

This folder contains fundamental Arduino projects for beginners.

## Typical Projects in This Category

- **Blink LED**: The classic "Hello World" of Arduino
- **Button Control**: Reading digital inputs
- **Analog Input**: Working with potentiometers and analog sensors
- **PWM Control**: Fading LEDs and controlling brightness
- **Serial Monitor**: Debugging and communication basics
- **Multiple LEDs**: Working with arrays and loops
- **Traffic Light**: Timing and state machines

## Key Concepts to Learn

- Digital I/O (pinMode, digitalWrite, digitalRead)
- Analog I/O (analogRead, analogWrite)
- Variables and data types
- Control structures (if/else, loops)
- Functions
- Serial communication
- Timing (delay, millis)

## Getting Started

Each project should have its own folder with:
- `.ino` sketch file
- `README.md` with circuit diagram and instructions
- Optional: images, schematics, or additional files
