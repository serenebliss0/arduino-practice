## ⚡ Electronic Circuits (No Microcontroller)

Learn electronics fundamentals by building circuits using ICs, transistors, and discrete components - **no programming required!** Perfect for understanding how hardware works at a deeper level.

### What's Included:
- **26+ Circuit Projects**: From beginner to advanced
- **Practical Learning**: 555 timers, op-amps, logic gates, counters, and more
- **Real Applications**: Amplifiers, power supplies, oscillators, sensors
- **Hardware Focus**: Pure analog and digital circuit design

### Why Learn Circuit Design?
- 🔹 **Understand Electronics Deeply**: See how components work together
- 🔹 **No Programming Needed**: Focus purely on hardware
- 🔹 **Complement Arduino Skills**: Better understand what Arduino does internally
- 🔹 **Build Useful Tools**: Power supplies, testers, amplifiers
- 🔹 **Lower Power**: Many circuits are more efficient than microcontrollers

### Circuit Categories:

#### Beginner (7 Projects)
- 555 Timer LED Blinker
- Dark-Activated LED (transistor switch)
- LED Chaser/Sequencer (4017 IC)
- Simple Audio Amplifier (LM386)
- Touch Switch
- And more!

#### Intermediate (9 Projects)
- SR Latch (Set-Reset Flip-Flop) ✅ *Already built!*
- Clap Switch (sound-activated)
- Adjustable Power Supply (LM317)
- Infrared Proximity Sensor
